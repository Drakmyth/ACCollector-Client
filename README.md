Issues
------
If you come across something that seems like a bug, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Make sure you are using the latest Release version of ACCollector-Client. If the error is occurring on [*INSERT PUBLIC INSTANCE URI HERE*] then this is true.
* If the bug seems to be in the server software, report it in [that repository](https://github.com/Drakmyth/ACCollector-Server). If you are not sure, report it here.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.
* If you have a crash report, please include that too by copying it into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and including the link. Just dumping a crash report directly into your report will cause your report to be closed without review.
